 Problem Statement:
------------------------------
Challenge Objective
For the Maven Hospital Challenge, you’ll play the role of an Analytics Consultant for Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH).

You’ve been asked to build a high-level KPI report for the executive team, based on a subset of patient records. The purpose of the report is to give stakeholders visibility into the hospital’s recent performance, and answer the following questions:

    How many patients have been admitted or readmitted over time?
    How long are patients staying in the hospital, on average?
    How much is the average cost per visit?
    How many procedures are covered by insurance?
    The dashboard should scale to accommodate new data over time, but the CEO has asked you to summarize any insights you can derive from the sample provided.
